        <p>The Business Owner enjoys the benefit of freedom and flexibility as they are not controlled by any employer, but they shoulder greater roles and responsibilities with many more task juggling. Over and all, the Business owner can run the gamut from planning business needs to arranging finance for the business. Some of the core tasks mentioned on the Business Owner Resume include – reviewing sales and financial goals, hiring staff, directing activities, delegating task amongst employees, taking responsibility of the business growth, stability and operations; and meeting all legal responsibilities.

            Being a Business Owner is not only a challenging move but also a great career one, hence these skills will be expected – solid foundation of business acumen, technical skills, knowledge of day-to-day operations, knowledge of basic bookkeeping and finance, strong knowledge of marketing and the ability to judge risk. It is possible to become a Business Owner without any formal education or training, but to survive in this competitive career, a Master’s degree in Business Administration will be resourceful.
